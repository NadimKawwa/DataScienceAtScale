/* Recall that a sparse matrix has many positions with a value of zero. 
Systems designed to efficiently support sparse matrices look a lot like databases: They represent each cell as a record (i,j,value).
The benefit is that you only need one record for every non-zero element of a matrix. 
Now, since you can represent a sparse matrix as a table, it's reasonable to consider whether you can express matrix multiplication as a SQL query and whether it makes sense to do so.
Consider that advanced databases execute queries in parallel automatically. So it can be quite efficient to process a very large sparse matrix --- millions of rows or columns --- in a database.
